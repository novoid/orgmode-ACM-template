* Migrating ACM LaTeX template to Org-mode

** Purpose

Whenever someone wants to hand in a white paper for a
conference which requires using ACM LaTeX template, I want to use an
Org-mode file instead. With the Org-mode LaTeX exporter (the current
one and/or the new one) is should be possible to generate compatible
TeX and PDF output.

** Template Source

http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

** Additional requirements

The template should be as much self-containing as possible. So no
special settings required in ~$HOME/.emacs~

* Issues

- Karl 2012-04-25: new Org-mode export does nothing but writing
  "org-splice-latex-header: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil"
